# Mock Bank Account Viewer

## Description

The mock bank account viewer is created to demonstrate my skills in the creating an app:

- client | React, Context api, React-router, typescript, tailwindCss
- server | Node.js, Express - mock api that uses json file within the codebase
- monorepo | Uses `concurrently` to run both client and server at the same time with one command line

## Usage

This app runs on `localhost:3000` for client and `localhost:8080` for server.
run `yarn start` to run both the client and the server.
